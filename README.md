# Hi, I'm Kenny 👋

I'm a scientist and engineer working on various projects inside the fields AI, robotics, software, and cloud infrastructure.
While my formal education was in physics, I chose to pursue a career in AI so that I could contribute practical value to society. 
The subject of my PhD thesis was the discovery of new radioactive isotopes, which involved complex statistical analysis of vast data sets.
During this time I became familiar with Python as a scripting language and developed a very comfortable fluency which has eased the transition from physics to computer science.

My interest in foreign language and culture has brought me to Japan on several occasions, first as an English teacher and now as an AI engineer.
I enjoy working on the development of NLP solutions to societal problems and the deployment of various AI models, such as ASR models and LLMs.
My main responsibilities at my current position involve the production and maintenance of a live transcription-translation application.
I have also performed research on voice activity detection (VAD) algorithms.
My secondary responsibility is performing system identification for a physical robot arm.
This project allows me to make use of both my physics background and my software skills.

- 🔭 Currently building a real-time transcription-translation web application
