# Hi, I'm Kenny 👋

I'm a software engineer working on the development of NLP solutions to societal problems and the deployment of various AI models, such as ASR models and LLMs.
While my formal education was in physics, I have chosen to pursue a career in NLP AI due to both a personal passion for language and a desire to directly impact society.
The subject of my PhD thesis was the discovery of new radioactive isotopes, which involved complex statistical analysis of vast data sets.
During this time I became familiar with Python as a scripting language and developed a very comfortable fluency which has eased the transition from physics to computer science.

- 🔭 Currently building a real-time audio-to-language interface
